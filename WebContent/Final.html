<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>Well, that's really all we have time for today. We read and discussed so many interesting articles and stories and the like, but the assignment for the final was only supposed to be 8-10 pages of work, and let's just say this has been slightly more than that. Now it's up to you to take the class and read up on what you saw here and much much more. I recommend this class to everybody, even if you aren't thinking about going into education. I learned so much that I can apply to so many different areas of study and of life, and you can to.
<p>Below is my works cited, I think I might try to make the pdfs to all of the readings downloadable from here but I'm not sure if that is allowed. We didn't have to buy any of our readings so maybe it is okay, who knows. P.S. that is a big plus, no ludicrous additional expenses just to take the course you want to take.
