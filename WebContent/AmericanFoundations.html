<p id="restOfPage1"> So, let's get into it. <br><br>The first reading we ever did for the class was Horace Mann's report no. 12 of the Massachusetss School Board. <br>Horace Mann had a vision where education would act as a "great equalizer," meaning it would provide a chance for people from all social classes to learn the same material in the same spaces. In his vision, this communal development would lend itself to social mobility, because no longer would one class possess all of the education. Education in a perfect world probably could work something like Mann envisoned, but Capitalism always finds a way to mess with everything, which you will learn about several times in this course. <br>Mann really wanted to avoid a dual track system like many European countries had, where working class families would go to school in order to learn working class jobs and middle and upper class families would go to middle and upper class schools and eventually get middle and upper class jobs. As we saw in the next reading though, those working class families who Mann thought needed it the most, were not actually the biggest supporters of public education.
<br><br>Our next reading was titled <i>The Irony of Early School Reform</i>, by Michael B. Katz. I found this reading pretty interesting. It's focused on the closing of a school in Massachusetts that was brought to a vote. The research done showed that the more upper class members of the community voted for the school, while the working class people voted against it. This showed a concept called, "reform by imposition", where the affluent leaders tried to impose their ideals on the rest of the population saying that it was for their own benefit, but not taking their opinions into consideration. Of course working class people did not want schools at this time, with industrialization changing the economy and society, schools would be taking children away from their families, who had been the primary source of education before. There are a lot of complex ideas crashing into each other in early education reform and a lot of conflicting motivating factors, I wish I could get into them but hey, it'd be good for you to look at the actual reading.</p>
