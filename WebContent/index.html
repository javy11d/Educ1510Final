<h1>Education Foundations</h1>
<h2>Final Project - Javier Dobles</h2>
<p>I am a first year student at Columbia University and just finished my first semester. 
One of my favorite classes was Educ1510, taught at Barnard by Professor Erika Kitzmiller and TA Corinne Kentor. 
Educational Foundations was split up into two sections, to quote the <a href="Documents/Revised-Kitzmiller-Education-Foundations-Fall-2019-Final-Syllabus.pdf" download> syllabus</a>, "Part I provides the groundwork for a conversation around what purposes education could and should
serve, prioritizing how we might create more equitable schooling experiences for all children. In Part II, we extend our conversation about the relationship between culture, learning, and identity. We explore
the way structural racism, class inequality, gender inequality, and various forms of identity-based discrimination
have interfered with our visions of education and its possibilities."</p>

<p>I have always been interested in education and have even worked for a couple different groups in educational settings, such as <a href="https://www.andover.edu/about/outreach/andover-bread-loaf">Andover Breadloaf</a> and the first ever Worcester, MA, chapter of <a href="https://www.massleap.org/youth-spoken-word-leaders-program">Youth Spoken Word Leaders</a>. After being involved in these groups I felt as though I had a lot of strong feelings about what Education is and what it could be, but I didn't really have the reading and evidence to back those feelings up. I mostly just continued to feel them and incorporate them in conversations where if I got called out, I would look really silly. This class covered everything from early French theory to contemporary research, and for that sweeping view I am grateful because I now feel as though I can really hold my own in casual and academic conversations.</p>


<p>Something else I liked about the class was the flexibility and autonomy we were given in our assignments. For our reading groups we could meet and talk however we saw fit, in class discussions were a judgement free zone, and even our papers, which were our biggest assignments, could be done any way we wanted. This meant poems, comic books, newspapers, anything. So I started thinking about what I wanted to do for my final project, because I was really not feeling just simply writing 8-10 pages of content</p>

<p>That's when I was inspired by the course to create this web project. A common question/theme that came up was, if we do not end up going directly into education, how can we use what we have learned in this class in other aspects of life, or how can we relate whatever it is we go into back to education. Education affects everybody, inside and outside of formal settings. I personally am a Computer Science major, I'm very interested in the Educational Studies minor, and wanted my final project to incorporate my varied interests. It's also Finals week here while I am typing this so I thought it would be good to have some fun with it, practice my web development skills, and maybe procrastinate, just the right amount.</p>

<p>And that's kind of that. Click around the links in the navigation bar at the top of the page to see more in depth descriptions of what I learned in this class, my takes on some of the readings, and what you will learn if you end up taking this fun and interesting class! Keep in mind that I didn't go super deep into any one topic, just enough to peak your curiosity and inspire you to learn more! Enjoy!</p>
