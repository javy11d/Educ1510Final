<h1>Old Man Theory</h1>
<p>No funny business here! This is the very serious old white man theory portion of the course. Some of the readings are actually pretty interesting and even the ones that aren't are still important! For one, people will definitely bring up the names of some of these guys in Education based conversations so it's best to be in the know, and also close readings of their work can bring about important insights and critiques.
<br>
<h2>Durkheim</h2>
<p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Durkheim">Émile Durkheim</a> was the first old guy we were tasked with reading. He kind of confused me at first much like the others, but after a class discussion I think I got the general idea on what he was talking about. In his article, "On Education and Society", he discusses how movement within education are always the result of greater societal movements and reforms. He talks at length about the Jesuit order, and how they modeled educational institutions after their ideals. He discusses how students of the order would be constantly supervised at all hours of the day, and how this was effective at molding the student into the upstanding member of society the Jesuits wanted them to be. I don't have too much to say on the piece, but as this was the first purely theoretical piece we read for the class I was pretty surprised by the language and style he utilized. After a while in Academia you get used to people trying to sound really sophisticated and eloquent in their writing though, so if you don't understand it at first just know it's not your fault that their writing is illegible.
<h2>Jackson</h2>
<p><a href="https://naeducation.org/philip-jackson/">Philip W. Jackson</a> was another old white guy we talked about, except he lived and published much more recently than Durkheim. For Jackson we read chapter one of his book, <i>Life in Classrooms</i>, which was kind of depressing. He basically rambles on and on about how terrible the current school system is, he talks about how parents lose several precious hours a day with their child for the majority of their life so that they can send them somewhere where they have no idea what is happening to them or what is being taught. He talks about how nobody involved in the process actually cares that much about children, saying that parents and teachers only care about how well the child is doing as it pertains to school. He also says that people involved in education to not pay enough attention to the trivial things that happen throughout the day, such as waiting in line, raising one's hand, sharpening a pencil, or yawning in class. He thinks that because these trivial events make up the majority of a child's school day and thus the majority of their young existence, it is problematic to let them go unnoticed. I thought that he definitely had some hot takes here and there and was right about some things, ut the main reason his piece bothered is that I couldn't tell what the point was really. He was not advocating for any reforms or saying XYZ are what we should do differently, he was really just trying to roast teachers and schools as much as possible. I could be wrong but that's just what it felt like to me.
<h2>Bourdieu</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Bourdieu">Pierre Bourdieu</a> in my opinion was one of the more interesting theorists we read. We read his article, "The Forms of Capital", and I thought it was an interesting take on a lot of what we had been getting at in class. He talks about how class and status in the world are not merely determined by income or traditional capital, and he emphasizes the importance of two other kinds of capital, cultural and social. Cultural capital has to do with the understanding or the possesion of all things related to culture and he talks about how that is related but very different from traditional capital and social capital. Social capital has to do with one's social standing which is also separate from income, I think Erika gave the example about how teachers often do not make that much money compared to a lot of vocational trades or other jobs, but people often look at teachers as higher class than people with those other jobs. To break up the monotony of this portion of my website, let's look at a quote from the piece we read: <br><br>
"The accumulation of cultural capital in the embodied state, i.e., in the form of what is called culture, cultivation, <i>Bildung</i>, presupposes a process of embodiment, incorporation, which, insofar as it implies a labor of inculcation and assimilation, costs time, time which must be invested personally by the investor. Like the acquisition of a muscular physique or a suntan, it cannot be done at secondhand (so that all effects of delegation are ruled out)."
<br><br> If this setence doesn't make a lick of sense to you, then we are in the same boat. I understand it a lot more after Erika explained it in class but it still could have been worded much differently.
<h2>Foucault</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> was also pretty interesting I think, and he is the last one I will talk about. In his article, "The Subject and Power", he talks about how we need to change how we look into different power dynamics. This reading was particularly challenging, but not because it was super hard to read like the others. This one was challenging because it did not speak explicitly about education. He mainly talked about the chruch and its followers and governments and their people and how by observing the actual relationship between a "ruler" and a "subject" we can learn about different forms of power in the abstract. The piece I think briefly mentioned education in a single sentence aside, but not enough to make the connection clear intially. That's part of the reason why I kind of liked this reading, it forced us to draw connections that we did not see right away which I thought really helped my understanding of the specific reading but also of other topics we had talked about previously.
