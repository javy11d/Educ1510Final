<p id="restOfPage"> All of the groups and people listed above played some role, big or small, in the fight for equality in Chicago alone! <br><br>
Some of my favorite readings were early on in the course, readings like <i>Political Education: Black Politics and Education Reform in Chicago since the 1960s</i> by Elizabeth Todd Breland, or "Choosing a School for my Daughter," by Nikole Hannah-Jones.<br><br>
I liked these readings in particular because they focused on stories and people that often go overlooked. To paraphrase the purpose of the Todd-Breland piece, black women organizing during the civil rights movement often did important behind the scenes intellectual work while being barred from leadership positions reserved for men.<br><br>
If you take this course, you will hear about all of these untold stories and more, I even wrote a paper for another class that used Rosie Simpson's story as a sort of jumping off point. I never would have known about her work if it wasn't for this class. She was a single mother from Chicago who organized black parents against the clearly unjust, ill treatment of their children within Chicago Public Schools. She lead protests, issued important statements, she even had a face to face meeting with the Mayor. The mayor was trying to discredit her protests by saying they were "outside agitators," so she brought a petition signed by over a thousand parents to show him! She was kind of a badass and not enough people know about her, so it's up to you to take the course and tell your friends!
